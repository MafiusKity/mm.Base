# mm.Base
A function in R to performing base conversion for vectors and matrices

## Use
For use this function, run the source in mmBase.R in any R enviroment and call:

```mmBase(m.base1,m.base2,vb1)```

This function expects that m.base1 and m.base2 are matrices that form a base in $R^n$ spaces, and vb1 has a vector or colecetion of vectors described in m.base1; return vb1 described in m.base2

The matrices m.base1 and m.base2 shall contain teh constituent vectors of the base cobinated in columns;
